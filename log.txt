Pneumoconiosis is a form of occupational lung disease that is not infective. It is a progressive (gets worse with time) degenerative disorder. It is caused by air pollution in the form of tiny particles. It was common among coal miners, who inhaled coal dust regularly.
Another type of pneumoconiosis is 'asbestosis', caused by inhaling asbestos fibres. A third type is caused by inhaling very small silica particles, called 'silicosis'. All forms of pneuomoconiosis shorten life, and have no cure.
Indications:
Having worked at an occupation with dust risks
Shortness of breath
Chest X-ray may show typical signs
